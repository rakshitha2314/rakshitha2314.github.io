I am a senior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Delhi, pursuing a major in Mathematics and Computing. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Naveen Garg](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~naveen/) and [Prof. Umang Bhaskar](https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~umang/).

My research interests lie in Theoretical Computer Science, particularly in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms. During my undergraduate studies, I have worked on Fairness Algorithms for Computational Social Choice problems and Approximation Algorithms for Facility Location problems. I like to work on developing algorithms and mechanisms for theoretical abstractions of real-world scenarios and interdisciplinary problems!

I am looking for PhD positions to begin in Fall 2025.
